# IoT-Forum-Traffic-Management-Project
A Government funded Traffic Management Project done by me and my peers from IoT Forum VIIT.
We had created a system wherein the timer of a signal would be adjusted based on the traffic density of that system.
We had used OpenCV,YoLo in the software part and and mounted this project on Raspberry pi 4 .We had used multiple Relays and traffic cones to create the model.
You can find the Model picture and its working video attached below.Incase of any difficulties/doubts do feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or whatsapp me on(+91 7758946564)
