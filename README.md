# IoT-Forum-Traffic-Management-Project
A Government funded Traffic Management Project done by me and my peers from IoT Forum VIIT.
My team created a system that would dynamically allot a timer for the lane depending on its traffic density. Such systems would help manage the traffic better and would also contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. Basically using OpenCV the number of cars in a lane was detected and based on the density we dynamically assigned timer to each lane. We developed our own algorithm based on priority queue. This project bagged top20 spot at a national level hackathon conducted by IIT Delhi.
